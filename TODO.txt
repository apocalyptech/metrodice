Real basic AI to play against

Some of our internal structures are a bit lame.  Player deck, for
instance, is just an unorganized list.  Various things along those lines
could probably be reimplemented far better.

The "events" which are currently just strings passed blindly back to
the user should really be more intelligent objects of their own, which
are machine-understandable.  A GUI might want to draw a picture of
dice in place of the numbers, for rolls, for instance, or allow
mouseovering a player or card name.
